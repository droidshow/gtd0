Having thought over the temple matter as I drove back from the meeting, mainly inspired by Trinity program and Saran's pics of Matsya Narayana temple; I think the temple can be the key component to the Chinmaya Mission, in the sense, I guess 80% people know about to Temples and Gods and only 20% actually know the higher ideal behind the symbolism.
In line with Gurudev's vision and mission motto, in order to lead "maximum" number of people from "Idol" to "Ideal" behind it: 
i) First we need a temple with "Idol" Lord Narayana's  and 
ii) Second we can have Sound & Light show in the temple which connects the "Idol" to the highest "Ideal" behind it.

I have this vision for the Sound and Visual show of 4-5 minutes  : 
Every hour, the entire light in the room/temple dims, slowly moving stars are projected in the entire room as the audio recording indicates it as the universe. 
The lights, underneath the water on which the Lord Narayana is resting, lights up and the water is agitated to form white froth indidcating "Ksheera Saagara", while the audio narration explains the symbolism and significance behind the milky ocean on which the Lord rests.
Then the focus lights on the "Shesha naga" lights up while the audio narration indicates its significance and its symbolism. Audio narration can explain how "Nara Seva" can be "Narayana Seva" showcasing the service wing of Chinmaya Mission and how Lakshmi follows where Narayana is being served.
The presentation will end with explaining how Chinmaya Mission's "mission" is to make accssible to everyone the knowledge of hgher "Ideal" indicated the scriptures and temples. So the temple becomes the gateway to the Jnana, which is what temples are.

If we do good job on this, in future other Chinmaya centers will visit Columbus and say we want to indicate the connection between the Idol and the Ideal like this. And there is still more scope to expand on this, like ticketed 3D glasses (the simple blue and red ones) to give depth to the projection of the universe. And possibilities with Virtual Reality headsets are endless.
I think this will leave a taste behind among devotees specially among younger ones that there is more to temples than what is apparent. This will not only be an attraction to masses but also address the critics concern about Chinmaya Mission + Temple. This aspect of the temple need not be be incorporated from the start but expanded as and when funds gets available but it might be easier to sell the idea of temple with this aspect.
And I feel some of the CHYKS might be attracted to such a concept and might have valuable inputs and be more willing to engage in its execution.
