Peetha:
 Chair:
  Chair and table on the stage might not work out.
  Is a suitable chair available to be borrowed ? I don't have a suitable chair at home, if none of us have a suitable one we will have to buy one.
  We can also do away with chair and setup like we did for Sw. Shantanandaji, basically sit on layer of cloths on the stage, foot on step and covered table in front.

 Cloths:
  Can anyone goto Ashram pick up the cloths box,  wash the cloths and return them, before Sunday ?

CD and Books,
 Balamurugan, instead of you setting up the book stall, I suggest you be on Swamiji's side constantly and let us know what he needs.
 We will get someone else to mind the book stall or I will do it.

Flower bed
 Puranbhai, Is Marcos going to clean up the flowerbed near the entrance?

Poorna Khumba
 Who is going to do the Poorna Khumba ? (Keep Coconut-Kalasha, Aaarathi, Matchbox, Prayer text ready)

Aarathi
 Will there be Aarathi? At the end or beggining?

Yajna Prasad
 Are booklets available to be given as Yajna prasad on the last day? Who is giving it?
 Do we need prasad (like almonds) for each day end after aarathi?

** WAY OF WORKING
*** Facility related tasks
- Send an e-mail to facility cordinator with task and its details
- Mention priority as A, B, or C ( A is highest and C lowest priority)
- Keep Puran/Venkat/Bala in copy of the mail
- If no objections the task will go into this TODO list http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/droidshow/gtd0/blob/master/cmc.html
- Facility co-oridnator will be *single* tasking off of this TODO list, so if you want your task done make sure it appears in this list
- Best way to make sure that the task makes it to the list is to send the mail to facility co-ordinator
- Assume atleast 1 week lead time from the time the mail is sent to task making it to list, task completion will take more than 1 week (unless emergency)

*** Snow clearing
Mail from Puran 
- There is no need to have it cleaned on other week days unless we have a function on these days and requested by Venkat, Bala or I. 
- One exception is Saturday's.  We have Sanskrit classes on Satrudays and should have it cleaned.  
- Please check with class timing with Venkat and accordingly instruct Hoffman Landscaping to clean it.  
-  We also have Abhishekam scheduled on Saturday's and need to do the same.  
- Hoffman will not know our Abhikshekam schedule and, there Dilip or Manubhai may need to remind you to schedule the cleaning.
- All requests should go through you(facility co-ordinator) and not directly to Hoffman.
