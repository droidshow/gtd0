SUGGESTION: Perhaps ask user to change password after first login
SUGGESTION: Fields like DoB and Phone need not be mandatory

Clicked on Enroll one of the profile, did fancy rotate to open a new frame the background text flipped.
SUGGESTION: The text flipping maybe a feature but causes visual pollution and hard to read the options for enrollment. As the enrolment prompt is not full solid background.
ISSUE: Register for drop down list, should be better sorted, 
ISSUE: should be better worded and perhaps be simple
ISSUE: Language class timings shows up as 0s
