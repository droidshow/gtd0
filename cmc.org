** WAY OF WORKING
*** Facility related tasks
- Send an e-mail to facility cordinator with task and its details
- Mention priority as A, B, or C ( A is highest and C lowest priority)
- Keep Puran/Venkat/Bala in copy of the mail
- If no objections the task will go into this TODO list http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/droidshow/gtd0/blob/master/cmc.html
- Facility co-oridnator will be *single* tasking off of this TODO list, so if you want your task done make sure it appears in this list
- Best way to make sure that the task makes it to the list is to send the mail to facility co-ordinator
- Assume atleast 1 week lead time from the time the mail is sent to task making it to list, task completion will take more than 1 week (unless emergency)

*** Snow clearing
Mail from Puran 
- There is no need to have it cleaned on other week days unless we have a function on these days and requested by Venkat, Bala or I. 
- One exception is Saturday's.  We have Sanskrit classes on Satrudays and should have it cleaned.  
- Please check with class timing with Venkat and accordingly instruct Hoffman Landscaping to clean it.  
-  We also have Abhishekam scheduled on Saturday's and need to do the same.  
- Hoffman will not know our Abhikshekam schedule and, there Dilip or Manubhai may need to remind you to schedule the cleaning.
- All requests should go through you(facility co-ordinator) and not directly to Hoffman.
